		OVERVIEW:
		OVERVIEW OF COMMON SENSE FILTER : (aka kalman filter)
		imagine a 1-D case. You have 1 position measurement device and 1 speed measurement device. say the error in speed is 0.1 m/s 
		(constant for the device)
		Assume the position measurement error is variable(which it usually is). Assume that the velocity is also more or less constant 
		(For the sake of simplicity)
		lets say that the initial position was X = 0. Assume that initially, position error was = 1
		At t = 0 the speed measurement device gave speed = 5m/s
		at t = 1 second, the estimated position = speed*time_elapsed = 5*1 = 5 meters.
		the error in the estimated position can be upto Previous_Error + (error_in_speed*time_elapsed) = 1 + 0.1 = 1.1 meters
		the position measurement device gives the position as 7 meters with an error of 2.2 meters. 
		the gain for the measurement is calculated as 
							error in estimate 					1.1
		gain = --------------------------------------- = 	----------- = 1/3 = 0.33
				error in estiate + error in measurement		 2.2 + 1.1
		
		corrected position = meas*gain + (1-gain)*estimate (1)
		the corrected position is = 7*0.33 + 5(1-0.33) = 5.66 meters. 
		now that the position has been corrected, the error in the position must have also been corrected and so the new position error is
		positionError = previous position Error * (1 - 0.33) ;

		These formulas can be derived very easily. The kalman filter assumes that the distribution of the variables 
		(estimated position and measured position)is gaussian (which is a fair assumption for most quantities). 
		When 2 gaussian distributions are multiplied, the mean of the new gaussian distribution is calculated by formula (1) 
		(you can try this yourself. Multiply 2 gaussian distributions and see what the final one's mean looks like)
		and the new "variance" (which we call error here) is the estimate's error multiplied by the complement of the gain.
		check out this website for more math http://www.bzarg.com/p/how-a-kalman-filter-works-in-pictures/
		
		Is the implementation here a kalman filter (or EKF)? Well, yes and no. Fundamentally, it follows the steps laid out above
		(which btw are followed by all variations of KF. The only things that change are how you get the error in the estimates). 
		However, the implementation avoids the use of matrices for the sake of understandability for the layman who doesn't have
		a clue what a jacobian matrix is. You see, in almost all implementations of the KF, the logic appears to be more complicated 
		than it actually is. This particular implementation isn't short but it is a lot easier to understand in my opinion because
		you can see what is really happening with the errors and the estimates. In other implementations, you look at a matrix 'Q' 
		and say oh its the covariance matrix and god only knows what's really going on with the terms inside it. Here, there is no 
		covariance matrix. The covariance matrix essentially represents the inter dependence between the variance of the variables 
		being tracked simultaneously (Say the inter dependence of speed and position). Here, I work with the terms that would be inside
		that matrix without ever invoking matrix into the code (error in position is dependent on error in speed which is dependent on
		error in acceleration.). Some part of the actual filter isn't even in this header file,
		it is in the MPU9150 header file(for a good reason which I will not elaborate here), 
		which is why I would suggest against copy pasting this implementation(also, why would you. 
		The code should be sufficiently easy to understand in order for you to write
		your own implementation of it for whatever purpose you may have).

		Extended kalman filter brief : 
		In a linear kalman filter, it is assumed that the estimate varies linearly and so does the error in the estimate
		(the 1-D case is a perfect example). However, if you consider a case where the object is moving in 2 dimensions,
		say moving on a curved path, then the error in the estimated position is not only due to the error in speed but also due to
		the error in the estimated bearing. When we deal with a 1-D case, the formula for error in the estimated position is obtained 
		from the derivative of the position, i.e., is position = V*dt, then position_Error = dV *dt, where dV is the error in speed.
		here, the position is 2 dimensional, position_X = speed*cosf(bearing)*dt, position_Y = speed*sinf(bearing)*dt,
		therefore error_X = (error_in_speed*cosf(bearing) - speed*sinf(bearing)*error_in_bearing)*dt and similarly you can find the formula for error_Y

		Now in a standard implementation of EKF, the above thing is actually represented by a jacobian matrix 
		(the determinant of the jacobian should result in the above equations). Here, I lay out the inner workings in plain view for all to understand.
		(Also, note that our state transition is not linear. Let me know if I missed something!)

		Also one more thing, This isn't a mathematically perfect implementation, and by perfect I mean absolutely perfect, like no discrepancies 
		between this and theory sort of perfect. When estimating position from the optical Flow, I don't consider the error in the heading 
		(it seems a bit dubious because the error isn't going to be integrated and the error in the optical flow readings is so small (at most 5 mm or so)

		This function takes data from position, Hdop and validity from gps, takes heading, heading error, acceleration, estimated Velocity,
		error in estimated velocity from IMU, change in position along car's X, Y axis, speed along car's X, Y axis, position Error and 
		Velocity Error from optical flow
		
		WORKING: (the comments alonside the code are also a part of this section)
		the velocity is estimated and error is integrated within the IMU code (MPU9150.cpp) itself but the corrections and bias calculations 
		are performed here
		The next order of business is to find the distance moved since the last cycle(2.5ms) (dS) based on the velocity estimate(V) 
		Then we compute the estimated position based on the distance moved(but this isn't the final estimate) from the IMU (Xacc->X accelerometer)
		then we compute the error in distance moved (dSError) and the error in the heading(well it's given already we just change the units from degrees to radians)
		the error in the position estimate is not just the error in velocity*dt. As explained in the Extended kalman briefing, the formula here is different

			We have the current estimate for the position, but the gps data corresponds to the position 100ms ago (the gps update rate is 10Hz).
			So we have to do the data fusion in the past, find the corrected position in the past and then shift the current position estimate by
			the difference in the corrected past position and the estimated past position.
			so lets take a simple example to understand the code. lets say during runtime, the last position known from GPS is X=1
			this would have been my position 200ms ago. The position I get now is say X = 3. This would have been my position 100 ms ago 
			(the gps data lags by 100ms).The last_X = (3-1) + 1 = 3.(its possible that the 1 wasn't 1 but like 1.25 after filtering, 
			making the actual last_X = 3.25 but we'll assume perfect case for now for the sake of simplicity).
			lets say my current estimate for position is 5 meters and my past_X was 3.4 meters. 
			lets say my past Error estimate is equal to the gps's Hdop(meaning both have equal error). So the filtered past_X = 3.2 meters
			now my current position of 5 meters is predicated on the assumption that I was at 3.4 meters 100ms ago. So, in order to correct that
			I will shift my current position by the "difference between past_X estimate and past_X filtered value", which in this case would be 
			3.2 - 3.4 = -0.2 
			meaning that my current position estimate is shifted to 5 + (-0.2) = 4.8 meters.
